### Under Review

![ç¤ºä¾‹å›¾ç‰‡](https://lintao.online/images/FASR.png)

- **FASR-Net: Unsupervised Shadow Removal Leveraging Inherent Frequency Priors**  [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05779)  [[code]](https://github.com/123pyLeo/FASR-Net) 
<br>**Tao Lin**, Qingwang Wang~, Qiwei Liang, Minghua Tang, Yuxuan Sun<br>

  FASR-Net, an innovative unsupervised network for shadow removal that leverages the frequency characteristics of shadow regions. Key features include a Wavelet Attention Downsampling Module (WADM) for enhanced shadow detail and novel loss functionsâ€”frequency loss, brightness-chromaticity loss, and alignment lossâ€”to boost performance. Our experiments on the AISTD and SRD datasets demonstrate that FASR-Net surpasses many existing unsupervised and supervised methods.
