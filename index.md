# About Me

<img src="https://lintao.online/image.png" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Tao Lin (Leo, ÊûóÊ∂õ)**.

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Kunming University of Science and Technology (KUST), advised by [Prof. Qingwang Wang](https://xzy.kust.edu.cn/info/1127/2815.htm) in the field of Computer Vision (CV), within the Intelligent Perception and Computing Laboratory. My past research focused on target detection and low-level vision. Currently, my research directions include **3D reconstruction**, **digital humans**, and **geometric modeling**. I am particularly interested in exploring multimodal technologies and embodied AI.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - leo040102 [at] gmail.com

## üîç Research Interests

- 3D reconstruction
- digital humans
- geometric modeling

I am eager to explore the integration and applications of **Multimodal Technologies** and **Embodied AI**. I believe these advanced technologies have the potential to significantly enhance the realism and interactivity of digital world modeling, as well as bridge the gap between virtual and physical environments. I am committed to dedicating my efforts to this meaningful pursuit, aiming to contribute to technological progress at the intersection of geometry, artificial intelligence, and multimodal interaction.
