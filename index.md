# About Me

<img src="https://lintao.online/image.png" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Tao Lin (Leo, ÊûóÊ∂õ)**.

I am currently a senior undergraduate majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Kunming University of Science and Technology (KUST), previously advised by [Prof. Qingwang Wang](https://xzy.kust.edu.cn/info/1127/2815.htm).

I have been admitted to the group of [Prof. Yuhui Wen](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/9986/) at Beijing Jiaotong University, where I will pursue my graduate studies. My upcoming research will center on **text/image-to-3D generation**, **digital humans**, and **vision-language model**, with the long-term goal of bridging vision and language models with real-world interactive systems.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - leo040102 [at] gmail.com

## üîç Research Interests

- Text/Image-to-3D
- Digital Humans
- Vision-Language Model

I am eager to explore the integration and applications of **Multimodal Technologies** and **Embodied AI**. I believe these advanced technologies have the potential to significantly enhance the realism and interactivity of digital world modeling, as well as bridge the gap between virtual and physical environments. I am committed to dedicating my efforts to this meaningful pursuit, aiming to contribute to technological progress at the intersection of geometry, artificial intelligence, and multimodal interaction.
