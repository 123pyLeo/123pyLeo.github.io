# About Me

<img src="https://lintao.online/image.png" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Tao Lin (Leo, 林涛)**.

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Kunming University of Science and Technology (KUST), advised by [Prof. Qingwang Wang](https://xzy.kust.edu.cn/info/1127/2815.htm) in the field of Computer Vision (CV), within the Intelligent Perception and Computing Laboratory. My current research include target detection and low-level vision. Moving forward, I am eager to explore and engage with multimodal technologies and embodied AI.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at - leo040102 [at] gmail.com
