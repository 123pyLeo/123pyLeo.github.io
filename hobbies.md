<br>Traveling removes my worries, refreshes my mind, and brings me the courage to tackle any challenges. I thoroughly enjoy the thrill of exploring new places and immersing myself in different cultures. Additionally, I have met many genuine friends during my travels and documented my journeys through photography.

<br>There must be something truly magical about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.

## My Cat

She is my love. Her name is Qbao (Q宝).
