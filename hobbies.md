    <img src="/images/tr3.jpg" class="floatpic">
</div>

<style>
    .third {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: flex-start; /* 左对齐图片 */
    }
    .floatpic {
        width: 100px; /* 调整为你想要的较小宽度 */
        height: 100px; /* 调整为你想要的较小高度 */
        object-fit: cover;
        margin-right: 1px; /* 可选：在图片之间添加一些间距 */
    }
</style>

<br>Traveling removes my worries, refreshes my mind, and brings me the courage to tackle any challenges. I thoroughly enjoy the thrill of exploring new places and immersing myself in different cultures. Additionally, I have met many genuine friends during my travels and documented my journeys through photography.

## Reading&Expressing

    <img src="/images/ex2.jpg" class="floatpic">
    <img src="/images/ex3.jpg" class="floatpic">
</div>

<style>
    .third {
        display: flex;
        justify-content: flex-start; /* 左对齐图片 */
    }
    .floatpic {
        width: 100px; /* 调整为你想要的较小宽度 */
        height: 100px; /* 调整为你想要的较小高度 */
        object-fit: cover;
        margin-right: 1px; /* 可选：在图片之间添加一些间距 */
    }
</style>

<br>Reading is like a journey of the mind across the wisdom of the world. We learn about different lives and get knowledge from books. Expression comes from what we've read and is like a spark of ideas. It can be as simple as sharing thoughts with friends or writing book reviews and stories. Reading gives depth to our expression, and in turn, expression makes us read more to find the true meaning of books. This cycle helps us grow and think better.
