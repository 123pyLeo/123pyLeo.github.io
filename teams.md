## 思网IdeaMesh

### Motivation

We believe AI can never truly replace human thought and expression—after all, human wisdom is boundless. That’s why we built a multi-perspective, inspiration-driven content platform. In this era of digital overload and algorithmic feeds, we want to preserve genuine curiosity (beyond just utility) and fragile authenticity. Our goal? To keep interesting, unique, and diverse perspectives from being reduced to clichés or templates.<br>

## WeShare Team

During my undergraduate years, together with Qiwei Liang and Yihao Hu, I co-founded a group named WeShare. Initially, we took the initiative in establishing the group. Driven by an entrepreneurial spirit in technology, we actively invited more individuals to join our team. As of now, the WeShare team has expanded to include 8 official members.<br>
